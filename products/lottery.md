# 🏛 Lottery

_The CBEX Vault platform offers users the opportunity to participate in a transparent and equitable lottery game using its native token. This lottery provides an exciting and engaging experience, with chances to earn substantial rewards while also contributing to the CBEX Vault community._

_To join the lottery, users must purchase a ticket using the platform's native token CBEX. The ticket price is determined by the total number of tickets sold, while the overall prize pool is influenced by the number of tickets sold. The more tickets that are purchased, the larger the prize pool and the higher the odds of winning._

_To ensure that the lottery is transparent and impartial, the winning numbers are chosen randomly through a smart contract. The lottery results are accessible to all users, and the winning numbers are announced regularly on CBEX Vault's website and social media platforms._
