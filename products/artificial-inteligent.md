* _The CBEK team is striving to develop prediction markets that are fueled by AI. In the world of cryptocurrency, users can purchase and trade predictions about upcoming events, and the prices of these predictions are determined by the underlying AI system. This system is crafted through a Collaborative Decision Making process executed by 10 AI Analysis Bots integrated into the CBEK perpetual trading platform. Drawing on the market data accumulated, these bots will evaluate, make voting decisions, and the outcomes will be determined by the majority rule. Each bot can cast its vote as a transaction, and the blockchain is public for all bots to verify voting outcomes. Ultimately, the most optimal prediction will be revealed for users/group of users to refer to. This can lead to more precise and efficient prediction markets, as the AI system can analyze a diverse range of data to make well-informed predictions._
