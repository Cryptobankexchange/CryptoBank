# 🏛 Trading

**Opening a Position**&#x20;

Click on "Long" or "Short" to open a leverage position on the desired side.

• Long position

• Earns profit if the token's price increases

• Incurs loss if the token's price decreases

• Short position

• Earns profit if the token's price decreases

• Incurs loss if the token's price increases

&#x20;

**Choose the leverage that multiplies your potential profit or loss on the trade.**

&#x20;

Enter the trade size, equal to margin x leverage. For instance, a trade size of 30 ETH at 30x leverage will use 1 ETH from your wallet's actual balance (margin).

&#x20;

**Funds**

• Funding charges accrue on an hourly basis while your position remains open. The confirmation screen before opening a position displays the hourly funding rate. All profit and loss figures displayed in your dashboard include funding charges.

&#x20;

**Profit & Loss**&#x20;

Suppose you opened a 3 ETH position at 2000. If the market rises by 1%, your P/L will be:

3 ETH x 1% = 0.03 ETH

If the market falls by 1%, your P/L will be:

3 ETH x -1% = -0.03 ETH

&#x20;

**Add Margin**&#x20;

• You can increase the margin of an open position by placing an order in the same direction as the current position. The new order's margin amount will be added to the existing position, useful when seeking to prevent liquidation or decrease leverage.&#x20;

Example

\-> You have a 70 ETH long on BTC-USD at 10x leverage (7 ETH margin).

\-> You submit a 50 ETH long on BTC-USD at 5x leverage (10 ETH margin).

\-> Your new position is 85 ETH long on BTC-USD with 15 ETH margin, i.e., 8.5x leverage. You've successfully added margin and reduced the leverage of your position.

&#x20;

**Closing Positions**&#x20;

• Click on the "Close" button and select the "Max" button in the pop-up window to close a position entirely. A summary of the trade (deposit) and fees will display before confirming the transaction. To partially close the position, enter an amount below the maximum possible. Select the currency to receive your balance when closing the position (last section -> Receive).

&#x20;

**Stop-Loss / Take-Profit Orders**&#x20;

• Set stop-loss and take-profit orders by clicking on the "Close" button and selecting the "Trigger" tab. Once you create a trigger order, it will appear in your position's row as well as under the "Orders" tab. Edit the order and change the trigger price if necessary. If you manually close a position, the associated trigger orders will remain open, requiring manual cancellation to avoid future order execution. Orders are not guaranteed to execute and can occur when the mark price, an exchange price aggregate, did not reach the specified price, or the order was not held long enough to execute, or no keeper picked up the order for execution. Also, trigger orders are market orders and are not guaranteed to execute at the trigger price.

&#x20;

**Share Position**&#x20;

• Share any position by clicking on the 3 dots next to it to open the 'Share Position' option. Click on 'Copy' to copy the image or 'Download' to download it. You can also share any position on social media by clicking on 'Tweet' to tweet any position.

&#x20;

**Liquidation**&#x20;

• The position is liquidated if the loss exceeds -80% of the margin
