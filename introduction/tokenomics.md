# üèõ Tokenomics

#### Completely tax-free on purchases and sales

_A fee-free transaction project has several benefits. First, it eliminates the need for users to pay fees when buying or selling goods and services on the platform, which can lead to significant cost savings over time. This makes CBEK Exchange more attractive to users looking to save money on transaction fees._

_Second, free transactions can lead to an increase in transaction volume on CBEK Exchange. When users are not charged fees on their transactions, they may be more likely to make purchases or sales, leading to more activity on CBEK Exchange. This increased activity can also lead to greater liquidity, which can make buying and selling assets on CBEK Exchange easier._

_Third, a fee-free transaction project can help level the playing field for smaller traders and investors. When fees are charged on transactions, they can disproportionately impact smaller traders who may not have the resources to absorb the cost of fees. By eliminating fees, smaller traders can compete on equal footing with larger traders, which can lead to a more diverse and decentralized user base on CBEK Exchange._
