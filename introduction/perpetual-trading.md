# 🏛 Perpetual Trading

_Perpetual trading, also referred to as perpetual swaps or perpetual contracts, is a derivative financial product that enables traders to speculate on the value of an underlying asset without a specified expiration date. While similar to futures contracts in some ways, these contracts lack a fixed expiry or settlement date. Instead, they are intended to be held indefinitely, with traders making regular payments to maintain their position._&#x20;

_This enables traders to capitalize on price fluctuations on an ongoing basis, rather than being restricted to the expiration of a traditional futures contract. Perpetual trading is frequently used in the cryptocurrency market, where decentralized exchanges (DEXs) often provide it as a means for traders to speculate on the value of a range of digital assets._
